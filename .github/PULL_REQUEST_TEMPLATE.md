## Changes

### Functionality
[Description of what was added, modified, or removed]

### Affected Layers
- [ ] Layer 0 (Foundation): Constants, type definitions, errors
- [ ] Layer 1 (Utilities): Crypto, configuration management
- [ ] Layer 2 (Business Logic): Domain models, validation, consensus

- [ ] Layer 4 (Infrastructure): P2P networking, external integrations
- [ ] Layer 5 (Presentation): HTTP API, interfaces

### System Impact
**Blockchain:**
[Changes to consensus, block structure, validation logic]

**Cryptography:**
[New or modified cryptographic operations, key management changes]

**Storage:**
[RocksDB schema changes, serialization format updates, migration procedures]

**API:**
[New endpoints, modified request/response formats, authentication changes]

**Infrastructure:**
[Docker, nginx, Terraform, GCP deployment changes]

**Frontend:**
[Dashboard UI changes, WebSocket events, user-facing modifications]

## Testing Performed

### Unit Tests
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New unit tests added for changed functionality
- [ ] Edge cases covered (empty inputs, boundary conditions, error states)

### Integration Tests
- [ ] End-to-end scenarios validated
- [ ] Multi-node network tested (local 3-node deployment)
- [ ] Consensus and synchronization verified

### Security Tests
- [ ] Malformed input handling tested
- [ ] Cryptographic operations verified (signatures, encryption, MACs)
- [ ] Authentication and authorization validated
- [ ] `cargo audit` passes with no new vulnerabilities

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Benchmarks run for hot paths (if applicable)
- [ ] No performance regressions observed
- [ ] Memory usage within acceptable limits
- [ ] API response times measured

### Manual Testing
[Description of manual testing performed, including environment and scenarios]

## Code Quality

### Pre-commit Checks
- [ ] `cargo fmt` applied
- [ ] `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` passes
- [ ] `cargo test --all-targets --all-features` passes
- [ ] Circular dependency checks pass
- [ ] Config regeneration successful (if templates modified)
- [ ] Module dependency graph updated
- [ ] Dashboard tests pass
- [ ] Terraform validation passes (if applicable)

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Code follows Rust best practices (ownership, borrowing, error handling)
- [ ] DRY principles and separation of concerns maintained
- [ ] Layer dependency hierarchy respected (no circular dependencies)
- [ ] Magic numbers/strings added to constants module
- [ ] Error handling uses `Result<T, E>` appropriately
- [ ] No `.unwrap()` in production code paths
- [ ] Constant-time comparisons for sensitive operations
- [ ] Proper use of `Arc<Mutex<T>>` for shared state
- [ ] Comments added for complex algorithms

## Documentation
